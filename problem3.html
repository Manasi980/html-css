The Tiger’s Nest Monastery is a sacred Buddhist site located near Paro, Bhutan. 
It was constructed in 1692, around the cave where Guru Rinpoche first meditated, the event that introduced Buddhism into Bhutan. 
There is a legend that Guru Rinpoche was carried from Tibet to this location on the back of a tigress, thus giving it the name Tiger’s Nest.

The Chomolhari trek is tougher than the Druk Path trek as it takes you closer in to the high mountains, meaning you spend more time at a higher altitude.
 You will be trekking on good trails but will definitely feel the effects of altitude, as you quickly ascend above 3,500m on the first day of the trek. 
 Saying that, you will have climbed up to the Tiger's Nest Monastery on the previous day, which will greatly help with acclimatisation.
